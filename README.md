# cloud-resume-challenge

The Cloud Resume Challenge is a hands-on project designed by [Forrest Brazeal](https://twitter.com/forrestbrazeal) to help newbies bridge the gap from cloud certification to cloud job. It incorporates many of the skills that real cloud and DevOps engineers use in their daily work.

I chose to do the AWS version with Terraform as my language of choice for the IaC part. Below is a progress update and a view of the current architecture.
